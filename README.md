# Image-classification
The goal of this mini-project is to design and implement an image classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Students will learn to handle image data, preprocess it, train a CNN, improve its performance, and deploy the trained model on an open-source platform such as Hugging Face or Streamlit.
